This app communicates with the Velleman VMA405 RFID module for Mifare tags.
VMA405 is based on NXP MFRC522 chip.

The pinout is as follows:

Vcc		+3.3V
SCLK	GPIO11
MOSI	GPIO10
MISO	GPIO9
NSS		GPIO8
IRQ		GPIO25
RST		GPIO24

MFRC522 Arduino Library was used for reference (https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid).
