README

This app will obtain pressure and location of the touch from a TSC2046 (or pin compatible XPT2046) IC.
Data bytes are transferred via the SPI0. Received pressure (Z) and touch coordinates (X, Y) are dumped
to serial console. The values are not normalized to display size.

SPI0 master is used.

The pinout is as follows:

SCLK	GPIO11
MOSI	GPIO10
MISO	GPIO9
CE0		GPIO8
IRQ		GPIO25 (unused)

The sample was tested against ITDB02-2.4E GLCD + touchscreen module.

XPT2046 Touchscreen Arduino Library was used for reference (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/XPT2046_Touchscreen).
