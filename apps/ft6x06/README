README

This app will obtain pressure and location of the touch from a FT6x06 IC.
Data bytes are transferred via the I2C. Received touch coordinates (X, Y) are dumped
to serial console. The values are normalized to display size.

I2C master is used.

The pinout is as follows:

SDA	GPIO02
SCL	GPIO03
IRQ	GPIO25 (unused)

FT6206 Touchscreen Arduino Library was used for reference (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_FT6206_Library).
